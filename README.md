Learning reflection from: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/learn-java-for-android-development-reflection-basics--mobile-3203
It's used to dynamically inspect and then use a method or class that may not be known at compile time. 
It's a good tool that can be used sparingly to great effect!

Here, I just rip apart the AerServ SDK's banner class with 3 reflection methods to see what methods, constructors, and fields are available. I don't actually invoke them or use them, though.
